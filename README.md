# Text Analyzer

Text Analyzer is a React-based project that provides various text manipulation functionalities such as converting text to uppercase, converting text to lowercase, and speaking the text. It's a simple and user-friendly tool that allows users to analyze and modify text easily.

## Features

1. **Convert Text to Uppercase**: This feature enables users to convert any input text to uppercase. It is particularly useful when you need to change the case of a specific text fragment.

2. **Convert Text to Lowercase**: This feature allows users to convert any input text to lowercase. It can be handy for scenarios where you want to make the text consistent in terms of case.

3. **Speak the Text**: This feature utilizes text-to-speech functionality to convert the entered text into speech. Users can listen to the text being spoken, which can be beneficial for individuals with visual impairments or for proofreading purposes.
